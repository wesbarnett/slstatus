slstatus - suckless status
==========================

For of slstatus. I removed all code that I don't use. Thus, this does not include all
the features of the upstream version. It does include a couple of functions upstream
does not (e.g., VPN, mail status).

slstatus is a suckless status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME
(e.g. dwm) or stdin to fill the status bar.
